# PdfCraft roadmap

The milestones, current progress and time estimates to Acrobat Pro feature parity. Keep this up to date:
- **Every session:** update the progress column and add a line to the log.
- **Every milestone:** re-estimate.

Detailed task lists and acceptance tests are in `plan/execution-plan.md` (local-only). This file is the public summary.

**What "parity" means here:** the offline feature set of Acrobat Pro, milestones M0–M14. It excludes Adobe's cloud services (Document Cloud storage, Adobe Sign, the Adobe AI Assistant). Those have no clean-room equivalent; PdfCraft's alternatives are local-first, plus opt-in providers (M13).

## Estimate summary

The unit is **wall-clock hours of agent work** (Claude Opus 5.5 coding continuously; human review time not included).

**Where we are (2026-10-07, measured by `cargo xtask parity` over 806 tracked Acrobat Pro features; 23 more are Adobe-cloud-only and out of scope):**

| Tier | Features | Shipped | Partial | Shipped % | Weighted % (partial = ½) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 (must-have for 1.0) | 251 | 222 | 25 | 88.4% | 93.4% |
| P1 | 326 | 174 | 38 | 53.4% | 59.2% |
| P2 | 186 | 14 | 7 | 7.5% | 9.4% |
| P3 | 43 | 1 | 0 | 2.3% | 2.3% |
| **All** | **806** | **411** | **70** | **51.0%** | **55.3%** |

**Effort-weighted parity: ≈ 30–35%.** Feature counts overstate progress: the remaining features include the hardest ones (our own renderer and font engine, editing existing text and reflow, OCR beyond Latin, XFA, PDF/A/X/UA preflight, Office export, long-term signature validation). Weighting each milestone by its estimated size gives about a third of the total work done. See **[Honest assessment](#honest-assessment-2026-10-05)** for what the numbers don't show.

**Observed throughput:** about 72k lines of kept, tested Rust (plus 97 agent tools and ≈ 600 tests) in roughly 65–75 agent-hours since 2026-09-30, about 1.0k lines per agent-hour, with corpus, oracle and visual checks. That is faster than the original plan assumed, so the hour estimates below are revised down from the first plan (2,000–4,000 h).

| Scenario | Remaining hours to full parity (M0–M14) | Calendar time |
|---|---|---|
| One Opus 5.5 agent, continuous | **≈ 600–1,100 h** | ≈ 4–7 weeks |
| 3–5 agents in parallel on separate crates | **≈ 250–450 h wall clock** | ≈ 2–3 weeks |
| With human review, integration and pauses | — | ≈ 2–4 months |

**How the estimate is built:** each milestone's remaining fraction (table below) times its size, re-based on the measured rate. The long poles are M2 (own renderer, ≈ 150–250 h), M7 (editing existing text and images, ≈ 150–250 h), M10 OCR and Office export (≈ 100–150 h), M6 JavaScript engine (≈ 60–100 h), M11 PDF/A/X/UA preflight (≈ 80–140 h) and M12 XFA/compare (≈ 80–140 h). The last 5–10% (odd real-world files, pixel-level polish against Acrobat) costs about as much as a mid-sized milestone.

## Honest assessment (2026-10-05)

Read this before choosing work. The feature table above counts what exists; this section says how solid it is.

| Dimension | State | In one line |
|---|---|---|
| Feature count | 51.0% shipped (P0 88%, P1 53%, P2 8%, P3 2%) | A typical viewer, annotator, form-filler or page organizer is mostly covered |
| Effort | ≈ 30–35% | The remaining work is the hardest: M2 15%, M7 17%, M11 18%, M12 23%, M14 0% |
| Foundations | Weakest | Rendering is still the bootstrap `hayro`; the inspector is `lopdf`; 18 vendored patches carried |
| Robustness | Early beta | Each 15-minute fuzz run found new out-of-memory crashes or hangs until 2026-10-05 |
| Acrobat fidelity | Unmeasured | No systematic side-by-side comparison with Acrobat, visual or behavioural |
| Product readiness | 0.2.1 | No code signing, performance budgets or keyboard-only operation yet; localization has its catalog system (English, partial Japanese) but few strings go through it |

**By area** (shipped share of each area's features):

| Area | Shipped | What's strong / what's missing |
|---|---|---|
| A Core | 75% | Parser, repair, encryption, incremental saves. Missing: lazy loading (`ByteSource`), own image codecs, PDF 2.0 extras, Arlington validation |
| F Forms | 71% | Filling, authoring, AF scripts, sandboxed JavaScript, data exchange. Missing: XFA, wider JavaScript object model |
| E Comments | 71% | Markup types with appearances, XFDF/FDF, summaries, calibrated 2D measuring (single-unit decimal scales). Missing: replace-text proposals, summary layouts, compound/fractional measurement formats |
| M Accessibility | 62% | Checker (all 32 rules). Missing: autotag, Tags/Order/Content panels, Reading Order tool, keyboard-only operation |
| B View | 55% | Shell, find, panels, tiles, web build. **Rendering is borrowed (`hayro`)**, so the 7 rendering P0s are only partial |
| D Organize | 55% | Pages, combine, split, bookmarks, labels. Missing: replace pages, transitions |
| G Protect | 54% | Passwords, permissions, redaction, sanitize. Missing: certificate security, redaction codes |
| H Sign | 48% | PAdES B-B signing and validation; macOS Keychain and Windows CNG certificate store signing. Missing: timestamps (B-T), LTV (DSS/OCSP/CRL), FieldMDP, smart cards, PKCS #11 |
| C Edit | 46% | Added text and images stay editable; header/footer/watermark. Missing: robust editing of existing text and images (fonts, subsets, reflow) |
| L Print | 36% | Acrobat-style sizing, n-up, booklet, CUPS. Missing: Windows and web printing, production options |
| J Create | 32% | From images, text, clipboard; Word/HTML/RTF export. Missing: Office import, Excel/PowerPoint export |
| N Misc | 27% | CLI, MCP, UI control channel, Action Wizard. Missing: AI providers, performance budgets |
| K Optimize | 26% | Reduce File Size, Optimizer. Missing: preflight, PDF/X/UA, transparency/fonts panels |
| I OCR | 19% | Searchable image for Latin script. Missing: other scripts and accents, editable-text output, deskew |

**What "shipped" means, and doesn't.** A feature is shipped when it exists and at least one specific test covers it. 159 of 398 shipped features rest on exactly one test, and only about 5 cite an external oracle (`pdftotext`, `pdfsig`, OpenSSL, a corpus). Shipped does not mean "as good as Acrobat".

**Robustness, measured.** `main`'s CI was red for 30+ runs until 2026-10-04 (a clippy lint, Windows line endings, flaky perf tests). Once the nightly fuzz job could finish, three 15-minute runs found 7 out-of-memory crashes (one aborted on every platform) and 11 hangs, 7 of them in our own `cos` parser rather than `hayro`. All are fixed or in review, but expect more: keep the nightly fuzz job green and turn every finding into a synthetic test.

## Where we're lacking and where we're going

The gaps that matter most, in priority order. Agents: prefer these over adding P2/P3 features, and check `parity/acrobat-features.toml` notes for the specifics of each.

1. **Our own renderer (M2).** Replace `hayro` with the `model` crate, our font engine and the DisplayList devices (ADR-0004). It turns the 7 rendering P0 partials into shipped features and removes most vendored patches. The largest single lever.
2. **Hardening.** Keep the nightly fuzz job green; fix every crash and hang with a synthetic regression test; finish lazy loading so large files aren't read whole; set performance budgets (`misc.performance-budgets`).
3. **Measure fidelity against Acrobat.** Build a side-by-side harness (render, text, form behaviour) over synthetic fixtures (`plan/acrobat/`, clean-room rules apply). Until then, parity numbers count features, not quality.
4. **Editing existing content (M7).** Fonts, subsets, reflow and CJK. The most visible gap for Pro users.
5. **Pro workflows.** Signatures with timestamps and LTV (M9), OCR beyond Latin (M10), Office import/export (M10), preflight and PDF/A/X/UA (M11), XFA (M12).
6. **1.0 polish (M14).** Code-signed installers, localization (the catalog system is in place and French, Spanish, Japanese and both Chinese catalogs cover the UI; Czech and Brazilian Portuguese still cover menus only), keyboard-only operation, a full screen-reader audit.

Decided against for now (owner, 2026-10-05): self-installing updates and an update check at start. Help ▸ Check for updates is manual only.

## Milestones

Hours are for a single agent (low–high). "Done" is the estimated fraction of that milestone's *acceptance criteria* that are met. It is not a count of lines of code.

Missing: certificate security, redaction codes and pattern locales, DCT re-encoding |
| M9 | Signatures (PAdES, validation) | 160–280 | 55% | 70–125 | Done: new `sign` crate (DER, X.509, CMS, PKCS #12 on RustCrypto; aws-lc-rs for RSA private keys); PAdES B-B signing (visible, invisible, existing fields, certification with DocMDP); validation with trust store and changes-after-signing classification; self-signed digital IDs; Signatures panel, message bar, sign dialogs; agent tools. Checked with pdfsig and OpenSSL. Done since: macOS Keychain and Windows Current User Personal store signing (software-backed CNG keys), certificate viewer, signed documents protected from rewrites. Missing: timestamps (B-T), LTV (DSS, OCSP, CRL), FieldMDP, smart cards, PKCS #11 |

Missing: fonts and transparency panels, space audit, preflight, PDF/A/X/UA |
| M12 | Accessibility, compare, measure, search, XFA | 200–380 | 23% | 155–295 | Done: new `a11y` crate with the Accessibility Checker (all 32 rules, report, Fix/Skip/Explain, options dialog and results panel, agent tools). Done since: 2D distance, perimeter and area measurements with persistent viewport calibration, snapping, live information and CSV export. Missing: autotag, Tags/Order/Content panels, Reading Order tool, alt-text workflow, compare, geospatial/3D measurement, search index, XFA |
| M13 | Automation (MCP, Action Wizard, CLI) + AI providers | 60–120 | 45% | 33–66 | Done: MCP resources (document info, text, page images); headless tool table (123 tools incl. signing, optimizing, initial view, links, stamps, data exchange, comment review, forms authoring and scripts, redaction, sanitize, print, add content), opt-in MCP server over stdio, CLI `run`/`tools` (closed stdout pipes exit cleanly), UI control channel with drag. Missing: Action Wizard, AI providers |
| M14 | 1.0 polish: performance, localization, installers | 120–250 | 5% | 115–240 | Done: PhotoCraft's translation system (`i18n/`: TSV catalogs, `tl!`, command-id and plural entries, system-language detection, strict catalog tests); every dialog, panel and notice goes through `tl!`; Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish and French catalogs have ≈1,800 entries each; Simplified Chinese and French coverage is checked against the UI source; Czech and Brazilian Portuguese for menus. French locales (`fr`, `fr_FR`, `fr_CA`) follow the French catalog. Missing: more catalogs filled in, installers, performance budgets |
| | **Total (original plan sizing)** | **2,085–3,840** | **≈ 35%** | **≈ 1,350–2,500 at the planned rate; ≈ 600–1,100 at the measured rate** | |

**Overall progress: about 30–35% of the effort (51.0% of features shipped).** The viewer and the core are far ahead of the editing features, because the viewer was built first so progress could be seen; rendering itself is still borrowed from `hayro`. See [Honest assessment](#honest-assessment-2026-10-05).

## Critical path

M0 → M1 → M2 → M3 → M4 must happen in order. After M4, M5–M12 can run in parallel across crates. The long poles are M7 (content editing), M9 (signatures) and M12 (XFA).

## Risks most likely to push estimates up

- Fidelity of text editing: fonts, subsets, reflow.
- XFA dynamic layout.
- Real-world signature chains and revocation checks.
- The rendering long tail: Type3 fonts, broken fonts, shadings.
- Correctness of PDF/A and PDF/UA conversion.
- CPU rendering performance on the web.
- Hostile input: every fuzz run so far has found new crashes or hangs.
- Unmeasured fidelity: without an Acrobat comparison harness, quality gaps surface as user reports.

## Log

- **2026-10-08 (M9, #179):** Windows Current User Personal certificate store identities join file-based digital IDs, signing through CNG without exporting keys. RSA-2048 and ECDSA P-256 round trips use temporary certificates with cleanup guards; enumeration, missing identities, automation errors and the password-free UI have regression coverage. Smart cards and PKCS #11 remain planned; overall effort estimate unchanged.

Newest first. One line per session: the date, what moved, and the new overall percentage.

- **2026-10-08 (M9, review of #144):** Trust work split from the algorithm/BER change and reordered on echelon's review. (1) Chain building checks what an issuer may do: CA:TRUE (old v1 self-signed roots count), keyCertSign, pathLenConstraint and validity at the signing or token time; before, any certificate whose key signed the one below could vouch for it, including an ordinary subscriber certificate embedded in a PDF. Negative tests issue certificates in-process. (2) A document timestamp stored as a signature field (Documenso's `Timestamp_1`, `/Type /DocTimeStamp`) was read as a CMS signature and reported "altered or corrupted" on an untouched file; it is validated as a timestamp now, and standalone timestamps are found by `/DocTimeStamp` as well as `/Sig`. (3) Trust sets are opt-in: `sign_trust builtin_roots` (22 pinned roots, now including OISTE WISeKey Global Root GB CA, whose pin matches Mozilla's root set and the root inside a Documenso-signed PDF) and `sign_trust eu_trusted_list <file>` (`cargo xtask trust-lists`; the 1.5 MB list is no longer embedded). Default: nothing but the user's own list is trusted; whether to ship built-in trust on is the project owner's call. With the roots on, the Documenso PDF validates as Valid (signature and timestamp); by default it is Unknown. The WISeKey download URL in the manifest could not be fetched from the build sandbox and is unconfirmed. Not run here: the wasm check and `cargo deny` (not installed). ≈ 30–35% (unchanged).
- **2026-10-09 (M14, Simplified Chinese About):** The About tabs, contributor controls and statistics, and model table now have Simplified Chinese translations, along with multiline link-privacy and cut-and-stack guidance. Coverage checks include direct `i18n::t` calls, multiline literals and dynamic credit labels; UI control checks exercise the translated About tabs and tables. Chinese font delivery remains incomplete; overall ≈ 30–35% (unchanged).

- **2026-10-09 (M14, #305):** Windows MSI rejects per-user installation overrides while allowing removal of legacy per-user installs and keeps its progress message visible. README documents unattended deployment without a desktop shortcut. Compiled x64 MSI checks pass; ARM64 install regressions added for CI. Overall estimate unchanged (about 30–35%).

- **2026-10-08 (M4, Combine files):** Combine files is now its own tab instead of a dialog: a table of the files (name, pages, size, modified, warnings) whose columns sort, resize and move, with the layout kept in the settings. Files, folders (optionally with subfolders) and open documents can be added, or dropped on the tab; rows select like a file manager (Ctrl/Shift), move as a block by toolbar, Alt+arrows or drag, and every change undoes with ⌘Z. Problems show before Combine: password-protected files, security settings that withhold page assembly, bad page ranges (checked as typed), duplicates; protected files unlock with their open or permissions password, also headlessly (`doc_combine` `passwords`). The result is never encrypted, and the list says so. `organize.combine-sort` shipped; `organize.combine-options` partial (open files). Still missing: protecting the result in the same step, file-size and PDF/A options. Overall estimate unchanged (about 30–35%).

- **2026-10-08 (M14, French):** Français (`fr`) is a complete interface catalog (about 1,880 entries), selected automatically for `fr`, `fr_FR`, `fr_CA` and other French locales, and from Preferences. Coverage tests check commands, All tools labels and every `tl!` literal; history labels keep captured names. Latin UI faces cover the catalog. Localization remains partial for Czech and Brazilian Portuguese; overall ≈ 30–35% (unchanged).

- **2026-10-08 (M14, right-to-left file names):** A tab with an Arabic or Hebrew file name showed replacement boxes. The interface now takes an `Arab` face from craft-fonts when the build input has one, and on desktop falls back to one font installed on the machine for characters no embedded face has (`PDFCRAFT_SYSTEM_FONTS=0` turns that off; README screenshots do). File names and paths in the tab strip, the recent-files list and Properties are put in display order, since egui joins the letters but does not reorder runs. Still missing: multi-line text (bookmarks, comments, search results), text input and a mirrored layout, so `misc.rtl-ui` stays planned; the craft-fonts revision pinned for releases predates its Arabic face, so release builds rely on the installed font until the pin moves. Overall estimate unchanged (about 30–35%).

- **2026-10-08 (community, M3, #214):** In single-page view, when the whole page fits, the wheel turns pages: one per wheel notch, one per trackpad swipe including its momentum. The rail gets a Page display button between rotate and zoom with Acrobat's view choices (Fit to width scrolling, Fit one full page, Actual size, Zoom to page level, Fit visible, Read mode, Full screen) and the page layouts. Preferences gets Default page display and Default zoom, which every new tab uses. In continuous view, Fit page and Fit height fit the largest page, so mixed page sizes no longer jump while scrolling. Overall estimate unchanged (about 30–35%).

- **2026-10-08 (M14, Windows Chinese Auto):** Auto now reads the Windows display language after locale environment overrides, selecting Simplified or Traditional Chinese through the existing locale mapping. Added Chinese region/script and Windows query regressions. Chinese font delivery remains incomplete. Localization remains partial; overall ≈ 30–35% (unchanged).

- **2026-10-08 (M3, themes):** Toolbar and Display theme now share System, Light and Dark preferences, one command path and persistent settings; the duplicate View toggle is removed. Effective colours track the OS only in System mode, with egui popup styles kept in sync. Overall estimate unchanged (about 30–35%).

- **2026-10-08 (M14, Simplified Chinese):** Added 208 translations, bringing the catalog from 1,625 to 1,833 entries. PhotoCraft-style coverage checks protect registered commands, All tools labels and UI `tl!` literals; generated history and diagnostic regressions preserve user values. Chinese font delivery remains incomplete: the release-pinned craft-fonts input has no Hans face and the web build only embeds the Japanese UI face (see #112 and #140). Localization remains partial; overall ≈ 30–35% (unchanged).

- **2026-10-07 (community, #208):** Measure: distance, perimeter and area annotations (standard LineDimension/PolyLineDimension/PolygonDimension with rectilinear /Measure), persistent viewport scales with two-point calibration, vector snapping (endpoints, midpoints, intersections, paths) through nested forms, live readings, CSV export, and eight `measure_*` agent tools. Hardened on landing: snap extraction caps segments and snap targets page-wide and skips undecodable streams and over-deep `q` instead of failing; unsupported imported measurements (compound ft-in, fractional, invalid geometry) are listed as unsupported rather than failing the list; non-ASCII units ("m²") are allowed and rendered in WinAnsi; a closing duplicate polygon vertex counts as closed. Distance and scale are partial (single-unit decimal formats only; Acrobat interop untested). 51.0% shipped; ≈ 30–35% effort.
- **2026-10-07 (community, #190):** Create PDF from Images offers embedded resolution, 72 DPI, or custom DPI (1–1200) without resampling. The engine and doc_create share the choice; Windows image context menus open the chooser through --create-images. Overall estimate unchanged (about 30–35%).

- **2026-10-08 (community, #135):** CLI output exits cleanly when a pipe reader closes early. Other stdout errors return a failure instead of panicking, and command/file errors keep their diagnostics. Synthetic subprocess regressions cover closed pipes and a reader stopping after one line. Parity counts and effort estimate unchanged (≈ 30–35%).

- **2026-10-08 (community):** Cut and stack in Print > Multiple: single-sided n-up sheets can be cut into cell piles and restacked in selected page order, with aligned gutter marks and blanks kept in their cells. Available through doc_print; duplex is refused. Grid-size overflow returns an error. No change to the parity count or the overall estimate (about 30–35%).
- **2026-10-07 (community, #161):** The "Save changes?" prompt keeps a long file name inside the modal: the title wraps to the dialog width, so the centered panel no longer stretches past the viewport, clips its message and pushes Save/Cancel off-screen (Windows report). The password prompt's file-name line wraps the same way, and a regression test pins the title and all three buttons inside a 1365×719 screen. Parity counts unchanged; ≈ 30–35%.
- **2026-10-07 (community, #143):** Windows MSI gets a full-UI welcome dialog with a "Create a desktop shortcut" checkbox (on by default; `INSTALLDESKTOPSHORTCUT=0` for unattended installs), progress, files in use, repair/remove, and a "Setup completed successfully" screen with Finish (plus distinct failed/cancelled screens). Start Menu and desktop shortcuts are now plain links to `pdfcraft.exe` instead of advertised MSI shortcuts. Packaging checks the compiled MSI's shortcut, checkbox and dialog tables; the ARM64 smoke test checks both links' targets, their removal on uninstall, and the opt-out. Installer polish only; feature counts unchanged. ≈ 30–35%.
- **2026-10-07 (localization):** The interface translates through the same system as PhotoCraft: one TSV catalog per language (`crates/ui-egui/src/i18n/ja.tsv`), the `tl!` macro, entries keyed by command id or with plural forms, and catalog tests (format, duplicates, placeholders, command ids). Catalogs are validated strictly (unknown escapes, reserved contexts, placeholders, ellipses, plural forms), a bad line is skipped and logged at run time, `fmt` substitutes in one pass, the drawing language is per thread, and each `.tsv` is an attributed asset (`kind = "translation"`, checked by `cargo xtask assets`); validation, attribution and the language-switch control test folded in from #175. The 49 existing Japanese strings moved over unchanged, plus `Auto`. The `language` preference now defaults to `auto` (follow the system language; English when it has no catalog); `en`/`ja` still persist, and unknown values are rejected. Not covered: dialogs and panels, Windows system-language detection. ≈ 30–35% (unchanged).
- **2026-10-07 (session 16):** PrintCraft is renamed PdfCraft: repo `storytold/pdfcraft`, crates and binaries `pdfcraft*`, bundle id `ai.storyteller.pdfcraft`. On first launch the app moves the old PrintCraft settings and crash-recovery folders to the new name, so upgrades keep recent files, preferences and unsaved work. No feature change. ≈ 30–35%.
- **2026-10-07 (community, #163):** Fill & Sign shows saved signature/initials previews with add, change and remove controls in the quick picker and left panel. The editor loads the saved typed text or drawn strokes; Apply replaces future placements and Cancel preserves the saved value. Existing annotations stay unchanged. Long typed names shrink to the placement width and include glyph overhangs in preview/PDF bounds. Regression coverage includes persistence, removal/recreation, long names and the opt-in UI control channel. Parity counts and effort estimate unchanged (50.2% shipped, ≈ 30–35% effort).

- **2026-10-07 (fork, default-workspace-mode):** Preferences ▸ Documents and view remembers the workspace used for newly opened PDFs. All Tools remains the default; explicit CLI/control mode overrides last for the session and PDF Initial View metadata stays independent. Overall estimate unchanged (≈ 30–35%).

- **2026-10-07 (community, M14, #112):** Simplified Chinese (简体中文, `zh-hans`) as a catalog of about 1,600 entries; `zh`, `zh_CN` and `zh-Hans` locales follow it. In Simplified Chinese the craft-fonts `Hans` faces come before the Japanese ones, so Simplified-only characters don't sit on a different baseline.
- **2026-10-07 (community, M14, #140):** Traditional Chinese (繁體中文, `zh-hant`, Taiwan vocabulary) as a catalog of about 1,800 entries; `zh_TW`, `zh_HK`, `zh_MO` and `zh-Hant` locales follow it. Drawn with the craft-fonts CJK faces (missing characters show replacement boxes).
- **2026-10-07 (community, M14, #141):** Every dialog, panel, notice, shortcut list and native-picker title goes through the catalog (`tl!`, `i18n::fmt`), and Japanese grows from 49 to about 1,800 entries (`ja.tsv`); worker threads (export, OCR, actions) write their summaries in the UI language; history labels keep captured file and field names; the command palette searches translated and English labels and ids. Engine and OS error text is no longer matched against English templates: it is shown as is, inside a translated frame. Localization remains partial for other languages.
- **2026-10-07 (session 16):** Signature validation made liberal in encodings and strict in cryptography. A real DocuSign + Telekom qualified-signature PDF showed "DER signature wrong" although Acrobat validates it: both CMS blobs use BER indefinite lengths, which our reader rejected (`der::Tlv` now reads BER). Behind that, later revisions that add DSS data (indirect `/Certs`, `/VRI`) or rewrite the catalog's XMP were classified as disallowed changes; they are permitted now, narrowly: only objects reached through `/DSS` `/Certs|CRLs|OCSPs|VRI` with the shape of their role, and new or only grown since signing, count as the store. A `/DSS` entry naming a page's contents, or a `/Type /DSS` or `/Type /Metadata` label on an existing dictionary, makes nothing permitted (review by echelon on #144), with negative tests at every DocMDP level. Also: RSA-PSS with any salt length (was digest-length only), RSA PKCS#1 with or without the DigestInfo/NULL, lenient ECDSA signature encodings, SHA-224, P-521 and Brainpool P-256/P-384 verification, legacy `adbe.x509.rsa_sha1`, and unsupported algorithms report Unknown instead of Invalid. Then the remaining validation algorithms: SHA3-224/256/384/512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256, RIPEMD-160, Ed25519 (RFC 8419), brainpoolP512r1 (hand-written on crypto-bigint, no RustCrypto crate exists) and RSA-PSS with its declared MGF1 hash and salt length (RSA padding checks now done in `rsa_pad` for every digest), all checked against OpenSSL-made CMS. Cross-checked with pdfsig (both signatures valid). Still missing: Ed448/DSA, AATL/EUTL trust lists (a separate change: they need CA-constraint checks in chain building first). ≈ 30–35% (unchanged).
- **2026-10-07 (session 15):** Five community issues, each with a regression test: in two-page view, Next page moves a whole spread (#77, #70); Export to Word opens in Word again, with control characters dropped and receipt-length pages kept within Word's 22 in, checked in Microsoft Word (#78, #72); macOS opens PDFs from Finder, Open With and the Dock (Apple events through the audited `fmv-macos-events`, PDF declared in the Info.plist), and the packaging no longer describes the image editor it was copied from (#82, #73); Add text keeps the box being typed when you click elsewhere, with Done and Discard beside it, reproduced and checked with real OS input (#86, #74); sharper, higher-contrast text, most visible on Windows, with every text colour at WCAG AA in both themes (#84, #76; the console window was already gone in 0.2.1). Still open: #79 (layered "not verified" signature appearances), #80 (native macOS menu bar), #81 (Homebrew and Scoop). P0 88%, P1 53%; 805 features 50.2% shipped (53.7% weighted). ≈ 30–35%.
- **2026-10-06 (community navigation):** Linux-only middle-button vertical scrolling in the document and Organize grid, toggled by clicking the wheel, with cancellation that protects page tools and selection. Scrolling stays on after releasing the wheel, even if the pointer moved before release. Manual feedback led to a Chromium-style distance^2.2 speed curve, a 15-screen-point dead zone, and continuous redraws that use elapsed frame time; the former linear speed cap is removed. Headless UI/control regressions cover fractional movement, consistent travel at 30/60/120/144 fps, pause/resume and cancellation. Other platforms retain their existing middle-button input behavior, with a regression that checks the custom scroller neither blocks input nor changes the cursor or consumes Escape. No new dependency. Automatic scrolling remains partial because keyboard-started timed scrolling is absent. Overall effort estimate remains ≈ 30–35%.
- **2026-10-06 (session 14):** Issues: move and resize existing text boxes in Edit text (#59, closes #40); Windows release builds open no console window and the Start Menu shortcut has its icon (#58, #57; rolled out to every Craft app); native Windows ARM64 installers, installed and run on an ARM64 runner in CI (#66, #71; the intermittent ARM64 test crash was a WARP shader-JIT race between parallel GPU-rendering tests, not our code); XFA forms are detected and explained instead of failing silently (#65, #60 stays open for real XFA). Also: squiggly underline tool, comment opacity, Preferences ▸ Identity, drag-and-drop/hover tests; community table export to Word/HTML/RTF (#62, with linear-time detection and a column cap). #63 (timestamps/LTV with outbound network) held for review fixes and an owner decision on network access. ≈ 30–35% (unchanged).
- **2026-10-06 (community, #68):** Interface language: Czech (Čeština, `ui.set language=cs`) joins English and Japanese. It translates every registered File/Edit/Pages/View/Help command and every label routed through the translation table, with tests that fail when a menu label lacks Czech; the interface fonts are tested to cover Czech diacritics. Dialogs and panels remain English (misc.prefs-language: partial).
- **2026-10-06:** M1: invalid object-number ranges in xref tables and streams take the existing reconstruction path, with the reason recorded, instead of overflowing or aliasing another object. Synthetic open/repair regression added. Overall estimate unchanged (≈ 30–35%).

- **2026-10-05 (session 13, later):** FreeBSD: CI builds and tests the workspace in a FreeBSD 14.3 VM (#45) and the release ships a FreeBSD x86_64 tarball, checked in CI (#42); README lists FreeBSD. Fuzzing: the nightly job's 11 hangs fixed (#41: our parser's exponential retries, inline images, Type 3 fan-out), plus a JBIG2 hang (#43, vendored hayro-jbig2) and a Type 1 font stack overflow (#46, skrifa 0.47); a full run now finds 0 crashes. Landed community PRs #36 (text editing, Japanese replacements), #47 (English/Japanese interface) and #48 (XFDF colour crash). Windows launch crash with Intel's Vulkan driver fixed by using Direct3D 12 (#49, issue #37); one copy of the Japanese font instead of two (#51, −8.3 MB); full screen and About get real tests (#50). P0 88%, P1 52%. ≈ 30–35%.
- **2026-10-05 (community, #47):** Interface language: Preferences ▸ Interface language switches English/Japanese and persists (`ui.set language=ja|en`, reported by `ui.state`). Core menu labels are translated; dialogs, panels and more languages remain open (misc.prefs-language: partial).
- **2026-10-05 (session 13):** Landed community PRs #3–#7 and the never-crash rollout (#11–#25); CI green on every job for the first time in 30+ runs (clippy 1.99, Windows line endings, perf-test noise); nightly fuzz job made to finish (child memory cap) and its findings fixed: 7 out-of-memory crashes (#27, #29, #30) and 11 hangs (in review); issue #8 (integrated GPU, keyboard save prompt); Help ▸ Check for updates (manual only). Added the honest assessment and gap list above. P0 88%, P1 52%; 804 features 49.5% shipped (53.3% weighted). ≈ 30–35%.
- **2026-10-03 (session 12, later):** Forms (merge data into a spreadsheet, Actions tab, automatic field detection and naming), Compare files (new `compare` crate: text and visual differences, panel, report, comments), Action Wizard (built-in and custom actions over files), PDF/A verify and Save as PDF/A (new `preflight` crate), Export to Word/HTML/RTF (new `export` crate). P0 88%, P1 52%; 803 features 49.6% shipped (53.3% weighted). ≈ 39%.
- **2026-10-03 (session 12):** Edit text and images in place (lines, paragraphs, formatting, existing images), Scan & OCR (new `ocr` crate on ocrs with CC-BY-SA models fetched by `cargo xtask models`: searchable image, page ranges, multiple files), Acrobat JavaScript (new `js` crate on boa: custom field scripts in Acrobat's event order, button scripts, document JavaScripts, console, Enable JavaScript preference, sandbox limits). 110+ tools; P0 88%, P1 48%; 803 features 47.9% shipped (51.1% weighted). ≈ 37%.
- **2026-10-02 (session 11, later):** Sign with macOS Keychain identities, Add alternate text, Advanced Search panel, space audit and link clean-up in the Optimizer, hybrid-reference files, signed documents protected from rewrites, redaction cleans the tags, custom stamps, image fields, Combine files with page choice. 97 tools; P0 82%, P1 45%. ≈ 30%.
- **2026-10-02 (session 11):** Accessibility Checker (new `a11y` crate: all 32 rules, report, fixes, options dialog and results panel), MCP resources for page images and text, revisions (list, open an earlier one), export all images, fit visible, form Preview and locked fields, document title in the window; plus attachment comments, eraser, date picker, duplicate/align/distribute fields. 91 tools; P0 80%, P1 43%. ≈ 29%.

- **2026-10-02 (session 10, last):** Manual tab order, backgrounds/watermarks from files (PDF pages as forms, images), Initial View and reading options (honoured on open), bookmarks expand/collapse, make-default comment properties, required-field borders, cut/copy/paste pages, marquee zoom, snapshot. 85 tools; P0 80%, P1 ≈ 27%.
- **2026-10-02 (session 10, latest):** PDF Optimizer and real Reduce File Size (new `optimize` crate: effective-resolution image downsampling, recompression, discards), Field Properties ▸ Options for every field type, Redaction Properties overlay styling, drag-to-reorder pages, repair notice and log; signature revalidation made incremental (comment edit on a 120 MB signed file 84 → 6 ms). 84 tools; P0 parity ≈ 80%. ≈ 27%.
- **2026-10-02 (session 10, later):** Digital signatures (new `sign` crate: PKCS #12, X.509, CMS; PAdES B-B signing incl. certification; validation with trust store and DocMDP-aware change detection; Signatures panel, message bar, sign and digital ID dialogs; signed documents keep incremental saves), polygon/cloud/connected-lines/callout/caret comments, Create PDF from clipboard, comment filters by colour and checkmark. Verified against pdfsig and OpenSSL. 83 tools; P0 parity 78%, P1 22.5%. ≈ 26%.
- **2026-10-02 (session 10):** Viewer conveniences (fit height, view history, cover page, close all, revert, system theme, find options), XFDF/FDF and form data exchange (new `xfdf` crate), stamps, organize extras (split by bookmarks/size, Extract and Rotate Pages dialogs), links (Link tool and properties, create from URLs), comment review (checkmarks, locking, copy text, hide all, summaries). Fixed the Comments panel's "…" menu, which chased the pointer. 79 tools; P0 parity ≈ 73%, P1 ≈ 19%. ≈ 23%.
- **2026-10-02 (session 9, later):** Print (n-up, booklet, poster, preview, CUPS), export JPEG/TIFF and create from TIFF/GIF/BMP, add text and images that stay editable, form formats/validation/calculation run natively (Acrobat's AF functions), field appearance, tab order, push buttons, 500-page frame budget. 67 tools; P0 parity ≈ 73%. ≈ 21%.

- **2026-10-01 (session 8):**
  - Commenting: sticky notes, highlights, underline, strikethrough, text boxes, freehand, lines, arrows, rectangles and ovals, with replies, status, colours, moving and resizing; Acrobat-style quick bar and Comments panel; six agent tools (an agent can highlight a phrase by naming it).
  - Protect Using Password, with Acrobat's permission levels and compatibility options; Remove security.
  - Filling in forms: text, check boxes, radio buttons, combo and list boxes, Tab between fields, Clear form; three agent tools.
  - Performance: opening a 190 MB manual went from 172 s to under 2 s; comment and form edits on it are 6× faster.
  - Fixed: saving a password-protected document failed; encrypted documents were not reported as encrypted.
  - Set Page Boxes, a Crop tool and Duplicate pages.
  - Header & footer (page numbers, dates, Bates numbers), watermarks and backgrounds, with Update and Remove.
  - Export to PNG and text; create PDFs from images, text or nothing; Reduce file size.
  - Fill & Sign: typed text, marks, the date and a drawn signature.
  - Comment properties, filtering and sorting; flattening comments and form fields.

  - Overall ≈ 16%.

- **2026-10-01 (session 7):**
  - Bookmark editing and page numbering (Number pages), with undo, agent tools and UI.
  - A render watchdog: pathological pages are skipped after 20 s instead of spinning forever.
  - The agent control channel no longer reports success when the window is hidden.
  - Community links: Discord button in the title bar, plus Home, About, Help menu, CLI and README.
  - Overall ≈ 10%.

- **2026-10-01 (session 6):**
  - UI control channel: agents can inspect the widget tree, click, type, press keys, run commands and take screenshots of the running app. Off unless the app is started with `--control`; loopback only, token-authenticated.
  - Combine and insert store identical fonts, images and other resources once. 40 copies of the showcase: 130 MB → 3.9 MB, 3× faster, pixel-identical.
  - Full saves use compressed object streams (showcase 3.4 → 2.8 MB; the 40× combine is now 2.3 MB). Fixed opening encrypted files whose catalog is compressed, and a crash on looped page trees.
  - Fuzzing (`cargo xtask fuzz`, nightly in CI): about 150,000 mutated files tried. Seven crash and hang bugs found and fixed, each with a regression test: two in our code, five in the temporary renderer.
  - Parity checklist: 826 Acrobat Pro features tracked in `parity/acrobat-features.toml`; `cargo xtask parity` checks every claim against code and tests. 11.8% shipped overall, 31.6% of P0.
  - Overall ≈ 9.5%.

- **2026-09-30 (session 5, after a machine crash; no work lost):**
  - Agent control: new `pdfcraft-automation` crate with 20 JSON-Schema tools, an opt-in MCP server (`pdfcraft-cli mcp`, stdio only, can be compiled out), and `pdfcraft-cli run`/`tools`.
  - Text on rotated pages now reads along its lines; the pdf.js oracle is unchanged at median 0.980.
  - Finding text in 520 pages: 17.9 s → 3.7 s (parallel), about 20 ms when repeated (cached).
  - CI: dependency licence audit (`deny.toml`, `xtask deny`) and a GitHub workflow for macOS, Windows, Linux and wasm.
  - Overall ≈ 8%.
